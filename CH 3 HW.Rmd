## Figure 3.13



```p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy in Years",
         title = "Economic Growth and Life Expectancy",
         subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
         caption = "Source: Gapminder.")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
