```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

## My First Figure 3.4
```{r gapminder}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
           mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                         y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point()
```



## Figure 3.13

:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = log(pop))) +
    scale_x_log10()    

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
